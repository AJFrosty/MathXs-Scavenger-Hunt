# MathXs Scavenger Hunt

üéâ Welcome to the MathXs Scavenger Hunt! üß†üîç

The MathXs Scavenger Hunt is an exciting initiative designed to promote creative, analytical, and critical thinking among the youth of Antigua and Barbuda. Running from March 14th to March 15th, 2024, or until the completion of the scavenger hunt, coinciding with the International Day of Mathematics and Pi Day, the project is tailored for secondary school and tertiary education students under the age of 21. Our main goal is to provide a dynamic and enjoyable platform that integrates mathematical concepts into a fun learning experience, enhancing participants' mathematical proficiency in a rewarding and stimulating educational environment.

## Rules:

To ensure a fair and enjoyable experience, please adhere to the following rules:

1. **Age Requirement:** Participants must be between 12 and 20 years old on March 14th.
2. **Residency:** Participants must reside in Antigua to be eligible for prizes.
3. **Mathematics Level:** Recommended mathematics level is 3rd form and onwards.
4. **Social Media Requirement:** Participants must be following [@mathxs_268](https://www.instagram.com/mathxs_268/) on Instagram and the founder of MathXs [@_ajfrosty](https://www.instagram.com/_ajfrosty/).
5. **Integrity:** Participants must not attempt to cheat.
6. **Collaboration:** Collaboration is allowed with eligible students, but prizes will only go to one individual.
7. **Team Size:** If participating as a team, teams may only consist of 2 persons.

9. **Unclaimed Prizes:** In the event no one wins the competition, remaining prizes will be given away through social media giveaways.

11. **Fair Play:** Play fair and, most importantly, have fun!

For Room/Clue 5 to 9, we will introduce the First Blood System. The first individual to solve the room, send the answer to the room/clue, and post and tag [@MathXs](https://www.instagram.com/mathxs_268/) on Instagram will receive special recognition and prizes based on sponsorships.

### Clue Passwords/Answers:
To get access to the next clue, you must provide the clue password obtained from the previous room into your current room. Every word in the clue password must start with a capital letter. Example: "This Is The Room Password"
