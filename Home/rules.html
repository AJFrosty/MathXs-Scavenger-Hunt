    <h1>MathXs Scavenger Hunt</h1>

    <p>Welcome to the MathXs Scavenger Hunt! üéâüß†üîç</p>

    <p>The MathXs Scavenger Hunt is an exciting initiative designed to promote creative, analytical, and critical thinking among the youth of Antigua and Barbuda. Running from March 14th to March 15th, 2024, or until the completion of the scavenger hunt, coinciding with the International Day of Mathematics and Pi Day, the project is tailored for secondary school and tertiary education students under the age of 21. Our main goal is to provide a dynamic and enjoyable platform that integrates mathematical concepts into a fun learning experience, enhancing participants' mathematical proficiency in a rewarding and stimulating educational environment.</p>

    <h2>Rules:</h2>

    <ul>
        <li><strong>Age Requirement:</strong> Participants must be under 21 years old on March 14th.</li>

        <li><strong>Residency:</strong> Participants must reside in Antigua to be eligible for prizes.</li>
        <li><strong>Mathematics Level:</strong> Recommended mathematics level is 3rd form and onwards.</li>
        <li><strong>Social Media Requirement:</strong> Participants must be following <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mathxs_268/" target="_blank">@mathxs_268</a> on Instagram to qualify for a prize and if you would like, you could also follow the founder of MathXs <a href="https://www.instagram.com/_ajfrosty/" target="_blank">Ajante Fraser</a>(Not Required).</li>
        <li><strong>Integrity:</strong> Participants must not attempt to cheat.</li>
        <li><strong>Collaboration:</strong> Collaboration is allowed with eligible students, but prizes will only go to one individual.</li>

        <li><strong>Submission Options:</strong> If you don't want to post on Instagram, you may send an email to <a href="mailto:a.tijorie.fraser@gmail.com">a.tijorie.fraser@gmail.com</a> with the relevant details needed for "First Blood."</li>
        <li><strong>Unclaimed Prizes:</strong> In the event no one wins the competition, remaining prizes will be given away through social media giveaways.</li>
        <li><strong>Clue Assistance:</strong> If barely anyone is solving a room, a clue will be given.</li>
        <li><strong>Fair Play:</strong> Play fair and, most importantly, have fun!</li>
        <li><strong>Clue Requirement:</strong> Some clues may require you to leave the clue room and go to another part of the site.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Concepts Involved in the Game and Key Terms:</h2>

    <h3>First Blood:</h3>
    <p>For Room/Clue Number 5, 7, 8, 9 and 10, we will introduce the First Blood System. The first individual to solve the room, send the answer to the room/clue, and post and tag <a href="https://www.instagram.com/mathxs_268/" target="_blank">@MathXs</a> on Instagram will receive special recognition and prizes based on sponsorships. In the event a player's Instagram page is set to Private then they should send the relevant information to MathXs' Instagram page / Email Address: a.tijorie.fraser@gmail.com.</p>

    <h3>In the Event of Winning Multiple Categories:</h3>
    <p>In the event a student wins more than one category, the category which has the highest value will be awarded to them, and then the other category would still be up for grabs. SHARING OF ANSWERS IS PROHIBITED. If caught sharing answers with Non-Teammates you will be disqualified. Extensive valid proof for solving a problem may be needed in some cases!</p>

    <h3>Clue Passwords/Answers:</h3>
    <p>To get access to the next clue, you must provide the clue password obtained from the previous room into your current room. For instance, you will enter the password obtained in Room 1 into the prompt box of Room 2 before you can get to explore Room 2 in question. 

        After exploring your current room you will decipher or solve a puzzle to receive the password to enter the next room. The password consists of several words, and each word must begin with a capital letter. For example, "This Is The Password."
        
        Consequently, "this is the password" and "THIS IS THE PASSWORD" are incorrect passwords. No solution will include all lowercase letters or all uppercase letters¬†for¬†each¬†word.</p>

        FOR THE FINAL CLUE, AND TO WIN THE COMPETITION, IT MUST BE SENT TO MathXs' INSTAGRAM/EMAIL!
